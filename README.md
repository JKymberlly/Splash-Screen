<h1>introduction</h1>

A simple project that took a while to complete, where I detail in Portuguese how to make a Slash Screen.

I'm starting simple projects with JavaScript. Being a beginner in programming, I want to become a front-end developer.

> The research for the project was done on internet pages and videos on YouTube.<br>
